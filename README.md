# CENG3420-Lab1: RISC-V Assembly Language Programing

## Lab 1-1:
Write a RISC-V assembly program step by step as shown below:

1. Define two variables var1 and var2 which have initial value 15 and 19, respectively.
(var1 = 15 and var2 = 19)
2. Print MEMORY addresses of var1 and var2 using syscall.
3. Increase var1 by 1 and multiply var2 by 4.
4. Print var1 and var2 again.
5. Swap var1 and var2 and print them. (var1 and var2 are changed)

## Lab 1-2:
An array array1 contains the sequence -1 22 8 35 5 4 11 2 1 78, each
element of which is .word. Rearrange the element order in this array such that,

1. All the elements smaller than the 3rd element (i.e. 8) are on the left of it,
2. All the elements bigger than the 3rd element (i.e. 8) are on the right of it.

## Lab 1-3:
Implement Quicksort w.r.t. the following array in ascending order:

-1 22 8 35 5 4 11 2 1 78
